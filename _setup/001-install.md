## About the ReDSS Project:

The Regional Durable Solutions Secretariat (ReDSS) is not an implementing agency, but a coordination and information hub acting as a catalyst and agent provocateur to stimulate forward thinking and policy development on durable solutions for displacement affected communities in the East and Horn of Africa. It seeks to improve joint learning and research, support advocacy and policy development, capacity development and coordination.

The ReDSS Solutions framework is a rapid analytical tool that offers a snapshot in time to assess to what extent durable solutions for displaced populations have been attained in a particular context. The Solutions framework looks at physical, material and legal safety of the displaced populations in comparison to the host communities. It is comprised of the 8 IASC criteria with 31 outcome indicators that are organized around physical safety, material safety and legal safety. 

This public ReDSS dashboard visually presents the Solution Framework analysis in various contexts to its stakeholder to enable them to: view the ReDSS Solutions framework indicators in use, identify priorities for early action based on the indicator rating, understand the key challenges in durable solutions programming, and identify the gaps that must be closed.

## Dashboard Content

Data is collected in the field by field officers and entered into a data entry spreadsheet. These data are then pulled into the ReDSS dashboard in real-time. 

The dashboard consists of two different views: a framework of indicators and a map. Users can change the data displayed for different populations, different years and different regions.

## Selection Panel

By default, when the ReDSS dashboard opens, a selection panel will appear on the left-side of the window with a default selection of: IDPs for population, Uganda - All regions for region, and 2017 for the year. If you would like to view a different population, region, or year, select the desired population, region, and/or year in this panel you would like to view and analyze. 

Your selection will be displayed next to **YOUR SELECTION** (as shown in the pink box below).

If the different selection fields are closed and not displaying all their possible choices, click the field heading. For example, in the figure above, if you want to view the contents under **Year**, you would click **Year**. 

### Hide the Selection Panel

In both the Framework and Map view, you can hide the selection panel by clicking the X icon in the upper right corner of the panel.

### Indicator Color Coded Rating

Next to each indicator is its color coded rating. The key for the color coding can be found in the upper-right corner. If you hover your mouse over it, the key will appear displaying the rating associated with each color. 

![](image_5.png)

Indicators with multiple colors means it has a intermediary rating between the two color ratings. For example, an indicator with a red and orange color rating has a rating between *Not fully met, obstacles exist* and *Far from met*.

### In-depth Analysis for each Indicator

If you would like a more in-depth analysis for an indicator, click that indicator and a pop-up window will appear. When you have finished viewing, select the X icon in the upper-right corner or click anywhere else on the Framework view to close the window.

## Map View

If you want to view the data on a map, you can select **Map** under **Layout** on the panel, and the map view will open.

### Solutions Framework Selection

Your selection from the Framework view will still to be the same selection for the population, region, and year in Map view. It will be displayed next to **Your Selection** as it was in the Framework view.

In Map view, you also select the indicator you want to view and analyze. To find your desired indicator to view, organized under its criteria based on IASC criteria, open the category under which the indicator and criteria are organized. For example, if I wanted to view **Adequate access to food**, under **Adequate standard of living (Access to basic and social services)**   I would open **Material Safety.**

You can also view a specific indicator in the Map view from the Framework view by clicking **View on map** from the pop-up window for the extended analysis of an indicator.
