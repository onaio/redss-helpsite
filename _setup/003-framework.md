## Indicator Color Coded Rating

Next to each indicator is its color coded rating. The key for the color coding can be found in the upper-right corner. If you hover your mouse over it, the key will appear displaying the rating associated with each color.

Indicators with multiple colors means it has a intermediary rating between the two color ratings. For example, an indicator with a red and orange color rating has a rating between *Not fully met, obstacles exist* and *Far from met*.

## In-depth Analysis for each Indicator

If you would like a more in-depth analysis for an indicator, click that indicator and a pop-up window will appear. When you have finished viewing, select the X icon in the upper-right corner or click anywhere else on the Framework view to close the window.
