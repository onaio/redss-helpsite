By default, when the ReDSS dashboard opens, a selection panel will appear on the left-side of the window with the Framework as the default layout selection. You must select your population, region, and year to view and analyze the data.

Your selection will be displayed next to **YOUR SELECTION** (as shown in the pink box below).

If the different selection fields are closed and not displaying all their possible choices, click the field heading. For example, in the figure above, if you want to view the contents under **Year**, you would click **Year**. 

## Hide the Selection Panel

In both the Framework and Map view, you can hide the selection panel by clicking the X icon in the upper right corner of the panel.
