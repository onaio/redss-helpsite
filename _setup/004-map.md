In Map view, you can also select the indicator you want to view and analyze. To find your desired indicator to view, organized under its criteria based on IASC criteria, open the category under which the indicator and criteria are organized. For example, if you want to view **Freedom of movement**, under **Protection**, you would open **Physical Safety**.
