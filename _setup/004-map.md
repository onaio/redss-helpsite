Your selection from the Framework view will still to be the same selection for the population, region, and year in Map view. It will be displayed next to **Your Selection** as it was in the Framework view.

In Map view, you also select the indicator you want to view and analyze. To find your desired indicator to view, organized under its criteria based on IASC criteria, open the category under which the indicator and criteria are organized. For example, if I wanted to view **Adequate access to food**, under **Adequate standard of living (Access to basic and social services)**   I would open **Material Safety.**
